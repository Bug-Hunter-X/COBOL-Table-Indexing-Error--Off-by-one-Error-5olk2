# COBOL Table Indexing Error
This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error when working with tables (arrays) in COBOL.  COBOL arrays are 1-based, meaning the first element is accessed using index 1, not 0. The provided code attempts to access an index beyond the bounds of the declared array resulting in unpredictable behavior.
The solution corrects the index bounds to prevent exceeding the array limits.  This simple example illustrates a pitfall that can cause runtime errors in COBOL programs.
